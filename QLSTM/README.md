# Quantum LSTM Reproduction (2009.01783)

This folder contains the reproduction of the paper:

- Title: QQuantum Long Short-Term Memory
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01783

## Layout

- `implementation.py`: CLI entrypoint to run baseline (classical LSTM), quantum-inspired / hybrid QLSTM variants, and ablations.
- `lib/`: Core library code (models, data, training, evaluation, quantum cell definitions, utilities).
- `scripts/`: Multi-seed sweep helpers, plotting, table generation.
- `results/`: Auto-generated metrics (CSV), checkpoints, and figures.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for key components (shape checks, forward pass, gradient flow, reproducibility).
- `notebook.ipynb`: Interactive exploration / quick smoke run replicating a small experiment.
